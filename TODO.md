# TODO: Adding Grades 2-5

## Grade 2
- [x] Adding two-digit numbers WITH regrouping (e.g., `54 + 28 =`)
- [x] Subtracting TWO two-digit numbers WITH regrouping (e.g., `72 - 35 =`)
- [x] Adding money (e.g., `1Q, 1D, 3N, 1P` → calculate total cents)
- [x] Equations without regrouping (e.g., `N + 43 = 95`)

## Grade 3
- [x] Short division with no remainders (e.g., `256 ÷ 4 =`)
- [x] Metric conversions (e.g., `2 m = ___ mm`)
- [x] Equations WITH regrouping (e.g., `N + 28 = 73`)
- [x] Multiplication & addition mixed (e.g., `4 x 7 + 3 x 5 =`)

## Grade 4
- [x] Equations with negative numbers (e.g., `N + -14 = -25`)
- [x] Two-digit by one-digit multiplication (e.g., `46 x 7 =`)
- [x] Adding & subtracting decimals (e.g., `1.5 + 2.75 =`)
- [x] Elapsed time (e.g., `12:14 a.m. to 3:31 a.m.`)

## Grade 5
- [x] Order of operations with exponents (e.g., `8² + 6 + 2 x 3 =`)
- [x] Equations with positive/negative decimals (e.g., `N + .3 = -2.7`)
- [x] Finding the mean (e.g., `4, 9, 8, 4, 6` → average)
- [x] Solving for x (e.g., `4x + 5 = 41`)

## UI Enhancements (Optional)
- [ ] Timer mode for competition practice
